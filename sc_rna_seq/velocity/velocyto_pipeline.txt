# pipeline for creat a .loom file with annotation of spliced and unspliced reads from the 10x mapping
output.

#install samtools form: https://github.com/samtools/samtools
#install velocyto CLI from: https://velocyto.org/velocyto.py/tutorial/cli.html

# first, locate the possorted_genome_bam.bam file in your 10x mapping (cellranger count)
# output folder. generate a second, differently sorted .bam file in the same subdirectory:
samtools sort -l 7 -m 2048M -t CB -O BAM -@ 16 -o /Bats/SC_Velocity/Bat_multi_RL/BAT7_blood_LPS/outs/cellsorted_possorted_genome_bam.bam
/Bats/SC_Velocity/Bat_multi_RL/BAT7_blood_LPS/outs/possorted_genome_bam.bam

# Note 1: The new .bam file is called cellsorted_possorted_genome_bam.bam for preventing difficulties in further steps.
# Note 2: After the -o flag comes first the path to the output .bam, then the path to the input .bam

# run the velocyto run10x command to create the .loom file:
velocyto run10x /Bats/SC_Velocity/Bat_multi_RL/BAT7_blood_LPS/ /Bats/ref_genomes/RA/RA_annotation_CellUCSC.gtf

#Note 1: First path is towards the whole 10x mapping folder with everything in it, second path is towards the genome annotation file.
#Note 2: velocyto run10x does not allow to specify an output directory. The .loom is directly generated in the 10x folder used as input â€“ 
	in a subfolder called "velocyto"
