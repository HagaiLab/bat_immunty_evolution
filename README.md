The scripts and documentations in this directory allow reproducing the processing of raw sc RNAseq ,the statistical analysis and the main plots. 

1) sc-rna-seq folder contains scripts for processing RNAseq using 10X CellRanger pipeline, as well as spatial data processing using 10X SpaceRanger and 
trajectory analysis using velocyto.

2) EggNOG folder contains scripts for running EggNOG orthology annotation mapper and processing its results for producing orthology relationship between species. 

3) cell2location folder contains scripts for using cell2location for cell type mapping using the spatial and single-cell transcriptomics data.

4) cross_species folder contains scripts for integrating cross-species datasets and performing correlation analysis of cell transcriptomes. Also contains different human tissues metadata (cell annotations and more) for analysis use.

5) differential_expression folder contains scripts for conducting DE analyses for both signle-cell and pseudobulk data.

6) coding_sequence_evolution folder contains a pipeline for running positive selection analysis of coding sequences based on multi-sequense alighnment data of complement genes with orthologs from different bat species.

7) figures folder contains scripts for reproducing main plots.
